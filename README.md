Package that contains all the basic files and folders that are needed to start a new project.

Works only with the latest Laravel 9 for now.

The package suggests to install [Laravel UI](https://github.com/laravel/ui) (Bootstrap) starter kit, and adds the chosen design theme on top, in addition to some features and generators.

---

## ` ‚ùó ` Important

This package must be used in a **NEW** Laravel project. Existing project functionalities, such as routes or controllers, may be overridden by Dotzonestarters.


---

## Features

Along with the Design Themes, Dotzonestarters adds a few features that are typical for almost any project:

- Main Page
- Login/Register Pages
- A generator command

<br/>

## Developing within a container

Internally, this package runs several `php artisan` commands during the installation process.

If you are developing with a container, like Laravel Sail or Docker, you can pass the `--php_version` flag to change this behaviour and avoid problems in the installation process:

```shell
php artisan dotzone-starter:install --php_version=./vendor/bin/sail`.
```

</br>

---
## Generator

To generate a new entity just run
```shell
php artisan dotzone-starter:generate {name}
```
where the `name` is the model name. This command will excute the following actions:

- Create the model and migration
- Create Controller with ready made functions
- Create Store and Update Request
- Create views like index, table and modal 
- Create custom Javascript file with ready made functions
- Add translation keys inside lang/en/messages.php
- Add custom menu to the sidebar menu list
- Add permission keys to the default permission seeder

All previews actions are generated for the management part of the webapp (Control Panel).
